# Problem Solving Approach

## Understand the Problem

* Can I restate the problem in my own words?
* What are the inputs that go into the problem?
* What are the outputs that should come from the solution to the problem?
* Can the outputs be determined from the inputs? In other words, do I have enough information to solve the problem? (You may not be able to answer this question until you set about solving the problem. That's okay; it's still worth considering the question at this early stage.)
* How should I label the important pieces of data that are a part of the problem?

## Explore Concrete Examples

* Start with Simple Examples
* Progress to More Complex Examples
* Explore Examples with Empty Inputs
* Explore Examples with Invalid Inputs

## Break It Down

Explicitly write out the steps you need to take.

## Solve and Simplify

* Find the core difficulty in what you're trying to do
* Temporarily ignore that difficulty
* Write a simplified solution
* Then incorporate that difficulty back in

## Look Back and Refactor

* Can you check the result?
* Can you derive the result differently?
* Can you understand it at a glance?
* Can you use the result or method for some other problem?
* Can you improve the performance of your solution?
* Can you think of other ways to refactor?
* How have other people solved this problem?
