# Singly Linked Lists

A data structure that contains a head, tail and length property.
Linked Lists consist of nodes, and each node has a value and a pointer to another node or null.

## Comparisons with Arrays

### Lists

* Do not have indexes!
* Connected via nodes with a next pointer
* Random access is not allowed

### Arrays

* Indexed in order!
* Insertion and deletion can be expensive
* Can quickly be accessed at a specific index

## Big O of Singly Linked Lists

* Insertion - O(1)
* Removal - It depends.... O(1) or O(N)
* Searching - O(N)
* Access - O(N)
