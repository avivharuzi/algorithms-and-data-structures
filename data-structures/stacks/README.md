# Stacks

A LIFO data structure!
The last element added to the stack will be the first element removed from the stack.

## Where Stacks Are Used

* Managing function invocations
* Undo / Redo
* Routing (the history object) is treated like a stack!

## Big O of Stacks

* Insertion - O(1)
* Removal - O(1)
* Searching - O(n)
* Access - O(n)
